\chapter{The Hill model}

In this chapter, Lie point symmetries for the Hill model will be calculated.
Since this work has already been done in \cite{ohlsson2020symmetry}, this will serve as a reproduction of their results.

\section{The Hill equation}

The Hill equation is an ODE that empirically describes cooperative binding to a multi-site protein.
It takes the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:original-hill}
  \dv{Y}{t} = - v_\text{max} \frac{Y^n}{K_m + Y^n} = \Omega_n(t, Y), \quad
  n > 0.
\end{equation}
By nondimensionalizing both the substrate concentration with
\begin{equation}
  y = \frac{Y}{{K_m}^{1/n}}
\end{equation}
and the time with
\begin{equation}
  \tau = v_\text{max} \frac{t}{{K_m}^{1/n}},
\end{equation}
\cref{eq:original-hill} simplifies to
\begin{equation} \label{eq:hill}
  \dv{y}{\tau} = - \frac{y^n}{1 + y^n} = \omega_n(\tau, y), \quad
  n > 0.
\end{equation}

\section{Finding a non-trivial infinitesimal generator}

For the remainder of this chapter, let \(y'\) denote the derivative \(\dv{y}{\tau}\).
