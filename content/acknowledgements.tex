\addsec{Acknowledgements}

Working on this thesis entirely during a pandemic has, to say the least, been a challenging experience.
I would therefore like to thank the people who have gotten me through this project.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisors: Johannes Borgqvist,
Fredrik Ohlsson and Marija Cvijovic.
You have given me guidance, not only in scientific matters, but also in how to navigate the new work environment I was thrown into.
Our weekly meetings have been a stable point in an unstable time, and will be missed even as this project draws to an end.

I would also like to thank the other members of Cvijovic Lab.
Having weekly check-ins with you has created something akin to a normal work environment during this time.
It has made all the difference.

Furthermore, I would like to thank Olle Lexell.
Our lunches have been a needed distraction from my work, even when they, as they often did, devolved into mathematical discussions.

Lastly, I would like to thank Emelie Sj√∂gren.
Your patience and positivity have helped me when things got too overwhelming.
I do not think everything would have gone as well as it did without you.
