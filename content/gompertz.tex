\chapter{The Gompertz model}

In several fields in and outside of the life sciences growth plays an important role in general.
In particular, when measuring different phenomena ranging from cell growth to the growth of cities, the concept of exponential growth often appears.
Exponential growth stems from a species growing in proportion to the size of the species.
Written in mathematical terms
\begin{equation}
  \dv{W}{t} = \alpha W(t),
\end{equation}
where \(W(t)\) is the size of our species (volume of a tumor, weight of an animal, individuals in a population etc.) at time \(t\).
While exponential growth accurately models initially growth for many systems, eventually some external factor will limit the growth.
The external factor might be simple like limited availability of food in the case of an animal population, or complex like limitations of infrastructure in the case of cities. % FIXME: Check validity of statement
Correctly modeling the external limitations is crucial when studying the long term behavior of the system.

The Gompertz model is one such model that has seen success in many areas. % TODO: Add references.
It was first proposed in 1825 as a means of predicting the mortality rate of populations in order to accurately prize life insurances and annuities \cite{gompertz1825nature}. % TODO: Add mathematical detail
A hundred years after its conception the model was suggested as a growth model \cite{wright1926reviews}, and a few years later saw its first use as a growth model modeling the weight of cattle \cite{davidson1928growth}.
In the century since, the Gompertz model has been used to model the size of a wide range of animals (for a good summary, see \cite{tjorve2017gompertz}).
The breadth of animals (and parts of animals) where the Gompertz model can be fitted well to growth data has made this one of the main areas of the life sciences where the model is used.
The other branch of the life sciences where the Gompertz model has seen success is in modeling tumor growth.
The model was first used (apart as a tool for making graphs \cite{casey1934alteration}) for this purpose in 1964 \cite{laird1964dynamics}.
It has since become one of the most widely used models for tumor growth \cite{gerlee2013muddle} (for a summary of applications, see the introduction of \cite{benzekry2014classical}).
When studying both organism and tumor growth, the same question have been asked about the Gompertz model, namely what the biological interpretation of the model is.
In this chapter, this question will be tackled using the theory of Lie point symmetries.

\section{ODE description}

The Gompertz model is most often used in the form of a parametrized univariate function, which is sufficient as description when modeling phenomena.
The form of the function describing the growth takes many forms, often varying depending on field and individual taste.
\cite{tjorve2017gompertz} shows that all useful formulations can be sorted into two groups, \(T_i\)- and \(W_0\)-formulations, with canonical forms
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gompertz-ti-function}
  W(t) = A e^{-e^{-k_G(t-T_i)}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gompertz-w0-function}
  W(t) = A \left(\frac{W_0}{A}\right)^{-e^{-k_G t}}
\end{equation}
respectively.
In these equations, and for the remainder of the chapter, \(W(t)\) represents a measure of size dependent on time.
The sufficiency of these two formulations stems from the interpretation of the four parameters \(A\), \(k_G\), \(T_i\) and \(W_0\):
\(A\) is the value of the upper asymptote, also known as the carrying capacity of the system.
\(k_G\), although lacking in interpretation itself, is proportional to \(k_U = k_G / e\), where \(k_U\) is the relative (to \(A\)) maximum slope during the process.
Together, \(A\) and \(k_G\) control the shape of the curve.
\(T_i\) or \(W_0\) depending on the formulation control the localization of the curve.
\(T_i\) is the point in time where the curve achieves its maximum slope, also known as the point of inflection.
\(W_0\) on the other hand is the size at \(t=0\).

For the purpose of finding symmetries, this description on function-form is insufficient.
Instead, an ODE-formulation is desired.
Several different ODEs have \cref{eq:gompertz-ti-function,eq:gompertz-w0-function} as a solution.
The ODEs found in literature can be rewritten on either the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gompertz-og-autonomous-ode}
  \dv{W}{t} = -\alpha W \ln(\frac{W}{K})
\end{equation}
as seen in \cite{bajzer1997tumor,delauro2014stochastic}, or the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gompertz-og-nonautonomous-ode}
  \dv{W}{t} = r e^{-b t} W
\end{equation}
as seen in \cite{burger2019epidemic}.
\Cref{eq:gompertz-og-autonomous-ode} is an autonomous ODE, while \cref{eq:gompertz-og-nonautonomous-ode} is non-autonomous.
This fact alone shows that the formulations are fundamentally different.
To further interpret this difference, the ODEs can be rewritten using the parameters in \cref{eq:gompertz-ti-function,eq:gompertz-w0-function}.
\Cref{eq:gompertz-og-autonomous-ode,eq:gompertz-og-nonautonomous-ode} have solutions on the forms
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gompertz-autonomous}
  W(t) = K e^{c e^{-\alpha t}}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gompertz-nonautonomous}
  W(t) = c e^{-r/b \cdot e^{-b t}}
\end{equation}
respectively, where \(c\) is an integration constant.
Comparing the general solutions in \cref{eq:gompertz-autonomous,eq:gompertz-nonautonomous} to the \(T_i\)- and \(W_0\)-formulations in \cref{eq:gompertz-ti-function,eq:gompertz-w0-function}, we find that the ODEs \ref{eq:gompertz-og-autonomous-ode} and \ref{eq:gompertz-og-nonautonomous-ode} can be rewritten on the forms:
\begin{flalign}
    \text{Autonomous, } & T_i \text{ and } W_0 :& W' &= -k_G W \ln(\frac{W}{A}) &&\FlLabel{eq:gompertz-autonomous-ode} \\
    \text{Non-autonomous, } & T_i :& W' &= k_G e^{-k_G (t - T_i)} W &&\FlLabel{eq:gompertz-nonautonomous-ti-ode} \\
    \text{Non-autonomous, } & W_0 :& W' &= k_G \ln(\frac{W_0}{A})e^{-k_G t} W &&\FlLabel{eq:gompertz-nonautonomous-w0-ode}
\end{flalign}
