\chapter{Modeling in biochemistry and ecology, and the possible uses of symmetry methods}

The theory of Lie symmetries is most often used in physics, but the mathematics involved are in no way specific to any given field.
The remainder of this thesis will be focused on exploring the possibilities and limitations of applying the theory to models found in biochemistry and ecology.
While symmetry methods have occasionally been used for such models, the application usually either focuses on models not representative of models used in biochemistry and ecology, or the symmetry methods are used for solving a very specific problem.
This thesis instead aims to take a wider view on the specific methods needed to find symmetries of such equations which, as it turns out, are fundamentally different from those used in physics.
