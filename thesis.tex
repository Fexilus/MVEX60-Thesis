  In biology, a common type of mathematical model is systems of first order ordinary differential equations (ODE:s).
  In general, large non-linear systems of ODE:s have no analytic solutions.
  However, using mathematical symmetries, differential equations can still be studied analytically without the need to find explicit solutions.
  But due to the historical development of the theory of symmetries alongside physics, the literature on finding symmetries of the type of large systems of first order ODE:s usually found in biology is sparse.

  In this thesis, four biological models using first order ODE:s are studied using Lie point symmetries: the Hill equation, the Gompertz model, the Lotka-Volterra predator--prey model and the Yildirim--Mackey lactose operon model.
  Symmetries of all models are found using ansätze.
  Additionally, symmetries are found using a repurposed method based on parameter independence.
  It is also shown that, using both methods for finding symmetries, sophisticated computer algorithms are needed for the calculation of symmetries of bigger systems to be viable.

  Additionally, the general structure of the symmetries is calculated for different formulations of the Gompertz model.
  It is shown that the two scalar Gompertz model formulations found in literature are symmetrically special cases of the original system formulation.

  Symmetries thus show promise of being a useful tool when studying mathematical models in biology.
